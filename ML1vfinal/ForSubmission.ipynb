I give away a lot of baked goodies as thank you gifts to friends, family and those who have helped and supported me and my family over the year, like my Vet and the hospital staff.  There is no comparison.  Everyone was asking what I did to the recipes to improve on already excellent products.  As I was making the doughs and batters, one taste told me that I was onto something great.  I'm not going back to regular sugars.  Muscovado is worth EVERY penny of the extra costs.  Try it once and you'll be hooked.  I am.  Just wish I had purchased it sooner.\n"

      "I recently purchased some unsweetened Belcolade chocolate in place of the usual Callebaut that I order I love Callebaut but it is very difficult to cut due to the thickness of the giant bars The chipped version available through some vendors is an inferior product Thus I tried Belcolade It is much darker than Callebaut and has a more earthy flavor characteristic of Dutching However it is better and more complex than other dutched chocolates like Lindt I would rate it as high as Callebaut and Valrhona and certainly better than Ghirardelli and the expensive Sharffenberger Best of all The Belcolade is delivered in small wafers and required no cutting just measuring in a cup It saves me a great deal of time and mess Also the price is right and less than virtually every other ultra premium brand\n",
